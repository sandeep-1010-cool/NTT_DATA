## üîí **Security Best Practices**

### **Repository Security**
- Use SSH keys for Git repository access instead of HTTPS with passwords
- Implement repository access controls with proper branch protection rules
- Use signed commits and tags for critical deployments
- Enable branch protection with required reviews for production branches
- Implement secret scanning in your Git repositories

### **ArgoCD Server Security**
- Deploy ArgoCD server behind a reverse proxy with TLS termination
- Use external authentication providers (LDAP, OAuth, SAML) instead of local accounts
- Implement network policies to restrict ArgoCD server access
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Enable audit logging for all ArgoCD operations

### **Secrets Management**
- Use external secret management solutions (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never store sensitive data in Git repositories
- Implement secret rotation policies
