## What is GitOps?

**Definition**: GitOps uses Git as a single source of truth to deliver applications and infrastructure.

**Key Understanding**:
- GitOps is **NOT** just about application deployment
- GitOps is equally important for **infrastructure management**
- GitOps provides **versioning, tracking, and auditing** for all changes

### The GitOps Workflow:
```
1. DevOps Engineer updates Kubernetes YAML manifest
2. Submits Pull Request to Git repository
3. Another DevOps Engineer reviews the changes
4. Pull Request is approved and merged
5. GitOps controller (ArgoCD/Flux) detects changes
6. Changes are automatically deployed to Kubernetes cluster
```

### Example Scenario:
```
Node Configuration Update:
- Engineer modifies node.yaml in Git repository
- Pull Request goes through review process
- ArgoCD picks up the change
- Node configuration is automatically updated in cluster
```

## Why GitOps?

### Traditional Deployment Problems:

**Problem 1: Lack of Tracking**
```
Scenario: Someone updates node configuration in Kubernetes
Issue: After 10 days, no way to know what changes were made
Result: No versioning, no auditing, no accountability
```

**Problem 2: Inconsistent Processes**
```
Traditional CI: Source code → Git → Pull Request → Review → Merge → Jenkins → Build
Traditional CD: Manual scripts → kubectl/helm → Direct cluster access
Issue: CD lacks the same rigor as CI
```

**Problem 3: Security Vulnerabilities**
```
Problem: Direct cluster access allows unauthorized changes
Risk: No mechanism to prevent or track unwanted modifications
```

### GitOps Solution Benefits:
- ✅ Complete tracking and auditing
- ✅ Automated deployment
- ✅ Security through Git workflow
- ✅ Consistent and repeatable process
- ✅ Auto-healing capabilities

## GitOps Principles

### Principle 1: Declarative
- **Requirement**: System must have desired state expressed declaratively
- **Example**: Kubernetes YAML manifests
- **Rule**: "What you see is what you have" - Git state = Cluster state

### Principle 2: Versioned and Immutable
- **Requirement**: All changes must be version-controlled
- **Flexibility**: Not limited to Git (can use S3 buckets, etc.)
- **Benefit**: Complete audit trail and rollback capability

### Principle 3: Pulled Automatically
- **Mechanism**: Changes automatically pulled from Git repository
- **Flexibility**: Can be push or pull mechanism
- **Implementation**: GitOps controller actively watches for changes

### Principle 4: Continuously Reconciled
- **Function**: GitOps controller continuously monitors cluster state
- **Process**: Compares Git repository state with cluster state
- **Action**: Automatically corrects any drift or unauthorized changes

## GitOps vs Traditional Deployment

### Traditional Deployment:
```
Developer → Manual Scripts → Direct Cluster Access → Deployment
Problems:
❌ No tracking mechanism
❌ No audit trail
❌ Manual intervention required
❌ Security vulnerabilities
❌ Inconsistent processes
```

### GitOps Deployment:
```
Developer → Git Repository → Pull Request → Review → Merge → GitOps Controller → Deployment
Benefits:
✅ Complete tracking and auditing
✅ Automated deployment
✅ Security through Git workflow
✅ Consistent and repeatable process
✅ Auto-healing capabilities
```

## Continuous Reconciliation

### How Continuous Reconciliation Works:
```
1. GitOps Controller maintains cache of:
   - All resources in Kubernetes cluster
   - All manifests in Git repository

2. Continuous Monitoring:
   - Reads current cluster state
   - Reads current Git repository state
   - Compares both states

3. Drift Detection:
   - If cluster state ≠ Git state → Drift detected
   - GitOps controller overrides cluster changes
   - Always takes Git as single source of truth
```

### Security Benefits:
```
Scenario: Hacker modifies cluster directly
GitOps Response: 
- Detects unauthorized change
- Overrides with Git repository state
- Restores desired configuration
- No panic needed - GitOps handles it
```
