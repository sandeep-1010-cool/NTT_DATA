### ðŸŽ¯ **What is ArgoCD?**

**ArgoCD** is a **GitOps-based continuous delivery tool** designed specifically for Kubernetes. It automatically **syncs your Kubernetes manifests from Git** to your cluster, ensuring the desired state is always maintained.


### **CD Workflow Without ArgoCD**  
1. **Process Overview**:  
   - A microservices application runs in a Kubernetes cluster.  
   - When application code changes (e.g., new feature or bug fix), the CI pipeline (e.g., Jenkins) is triggered automatically.  
   - The pipeline tests the changes, builds a new Docker image, and pushes it to a Docker repository.  
   - Jenkins updates the Kubernetes deployment YAML file with the new image tag.  
   - Using tools like `kubectl`, Jenkins applies the updated deployment file to Kubernetes.  

2. **Challenges**:  
   - **Tool Setup**:  
     - Requires installing tools like `kubectl`, Helm, etc., on CI tools like Jenkins.  
     - Additional configuration effort to set up these tools.  

   - **Credential Management**:  
     - Kubernetes credentials must be configured in Jenkins.  
     - If using AWS EKS, AWS credentials must also be added.  
     - Security concerns arise as cluster credentials are shared with external tools.  
     - Managing credentials for multiple projects or clusters becomes complex (e.g., 50 projects or 50 clusters).  

   - **Deployment Visibility**:  
     - Jenkins has no visibility into the deployment status after applying changes.  
     - It cannot verify if the application is healthy or failing in Kubernetes.  

3. **Solution with ArgoCD**:  
   - ArgoCD is purpose-built for Kubernetes and follows GitOps principles.  
   - It addresses the challenges by:  
     - Automating deployments directly from Git repositories.  
     - Reducing the need for external tools like `kubectl` or Helm.  
     - Simplifying credential management with GitOps workflows.  
     - Providing real-time visibility into the deployment status (e.g., application health).


### **How ArgoCD Makes the Process More Efficient**  

1. **Reversing the Flow**:  
   - Instead of external tools (e.g., Jenkins) accessing the Kubernetes cluster, **ArgoCD becomes part of the cluster** itself.  
   - This eliminates the need for external tools like `kubectl` or Helm to push changes to the cluster.  

2. **Pull Workflow**:  
   - ArgoCD uses a **pull-based workflow** where an agent within the cluster (ArgoCD) pulls changes from Git repositories and applies them directly.  
   - This ensures changes are applied securely and efficiently without external access.  

3. **Addressing Challenges**:  
   - **Tool Setup**:  
     - No need to install or configure external tools on CI systems like Jenkins.  
     - ArgoCD operates directly within the cluster.  

   - **Credential Management**:  
     - No external tools require Kubernetes or AWS credentials.  
     - Credentials are managed securely within the cluster, reducing security risks.  

   - **Deployment Visibility**:  
     - Provides real-time visibility into deployment status (e.g., application health, failures).  
     - Ensures the CI/CD pipeline knows whether the application is successfully deployed and running.  

### **Efficiency**:  
By pulling changes and operating within the cluster, ArgoCD simplifies the workflow, improves security, and ensures better deployment monitoring and management.

### **Workflow with ArgoCD**  

1. **Deploy ArgoCD in the Cluster**:  
   - ArgoCD is installed within the Kubernetes cluster.  
   - Configure ArgoCD to connect to a Git repository and monitor it for changes.  

2. **Workflow Overview**:  
   - **Developer Workflow**:  
     - Developers commit application changes to the **application source code repository**.  
     - CI pipeline (e.g., Jenkins) is triggered automatically.  
     - Jenkins tests the changes, builds a Docker image, pushes it to the Docker repository, and updates the Kubernetes manifest file (e.g., `deployment.yaml`) with the new image version.  

   - **Best Practice**:  
     - Separate repositories are used for:  
       - **Application source code** (e.g., code changes).  
       - **Application configuration code** (e.g., Kubernetes manifests like `configMap`, `Secret`, `Service`, `Ingress`, etc.).  
     - This allows independent updates to configuration files without triggering the CI pipeline unnecessarily.  

3. **ArgoCD Process**:  
   - Jenkins updates the **application configuration repository** (e.g., deployment YAML file with new image tags).  
   - ArgoCD, configured to monitor this repository, detects changes immediately.  
   - ArgoCD pulls the updated configuration files and applies them in the cluster automatically.  

4. **Supported File Types**:  
   - ArgoCD supports:  
     - Plain YAML files.  
     - Helm charts.  
     - Kustomize files.  
     - Other template files that generate Kubernetes manifests.  

5. **Separation of Concerns**:  
   - **CI Pipeline**:  
     - Owned by developers.  
     - Configured on Jenkins for tasks like testing, building, and pushing images.  
   - **CD Pipeline**:  
     - Owned by operations or DevOps teams.  
     - Configured using ArgoCD to manage deployment and configuration changes.  

### **Result**:  
- Changes in the application configuration repository (whether by Jenkins or DevOps engineers) are automatically pulled and applied by ArgoCD.  
- This creates an automated CI/CD pipeline with clear separation of responsibilities between developers and operations teams.
