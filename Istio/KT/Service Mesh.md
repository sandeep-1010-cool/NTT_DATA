Hereâ€™s the **basic OpenShift traffic flow without service mesh** â€” step by step:

### 1. Client to Load Balancer

* User makes a request to an application (via DNS).
* DNS entry points to a **load balancer** (e.g., Netscaler).
* Load balancer distributes requests across OpenShift router nodes.

### 2. OpenShift Router (HAProxy)

* The request hits the **OpenShift router**, which is HAProxy.
* The router checks the **Route object** for the app.
* The TLS/HTTPS certificate is usually tied to this Route.

### 3. Route to Service

* The **Route** maps incoming traffic (domain name, path) â†’ to a **Service** inside the cluster.
* Service is a stable endpoint (ClusterIP) that represents one or more pods.

### 4. Service to Pod

* The **Service** forwards the request to one of the backend **Pods** (microservice).
* Pod selection is done by kube-proxy using iptables or IPVS (round-robin or other methods).

### 5. Pod Handles Request

* Finally, the microservice Pod processes the request and sends the response back the same path.

Would you like me to also **draw this as a simple diagram** (boxes/arrows flow) so you can visualize it easily before we compare with service mesh?
