Great start 🚀 — you’ve captured the **baseline networking flow in OpenShift** really well.

Here’s how I’d mentor you step by step for **Module 1**:

---

### Step 1: Pods — the smallest unit

* **What they are:** A pod = wrapper around 1 or more containers.
* **Networking rule:** Each pod gets its **own IP** inside the cluster (ephemeral, changes if pod restarts).
* **Challenge:** Since pod IPs are not stable, you can’t directly rely on them.

---

### Step 2: Services — the stable address

* **What they do:** Services (ClusterIP) act like a **stable virtual IP**.
* **How they work:** Use **kube-proxy + iptables** to forward traffic to pods behind the service.
* **Benefit:** Client apps don’t care about pod churn.

---

### Step 3: External Access in OpenShift

* Users outside the cluster → DNS → External Load Balancer → OpenShift Router (HAProxy) → Route → Service → Pod.
* **Router (HAProxy):** Handles **hostnames, TLS termination, and routing** to the right Service.
* **Route:** The OpenShift object mapping external hostname → internal service.

---

### Step 4: L4 vs L7 Networking

* **L4 (TCP/UDP):** Deals with IP addresses + ports. Doesn’t understand the application protocol.
* **L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC):** Smarter, can do path-based routing, TLS termination, header inspection.
* **Router works at L7** (can inspect HTTP headers, TLS SNI, etc.).

---

### Step 5: TLS in baseline OpenShift

* By default, TLS is between **client and the router/route**.
* **Inside the cluster (Service → Pod), traffic is usually plaintext.**
* You must configure app-level TLS if you want pod-to-pod encryption.

✅ **You’re now ready with the baseline** → This foundation will make Istio’s “extra features” (like automatic pod-to-pod TLS, retries, and traffic splitting) crystal clear.

👉 My suggestion: Next, we create a **comparison table**: “Without Mesh vs With Mesh” at this level, so your brain builds an anchor before we move to Istio.

Would you like me to make that **comparison table** before we start Module 2?
