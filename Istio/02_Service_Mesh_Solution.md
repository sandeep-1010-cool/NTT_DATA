# Service Mesh Solution

## 3. How Service Mesh Solves These Challenges

### The Sidecar Pattern Solution
**Core Idea:** Extract all non-business logic out of microservices into a separate **sidecar application**

**Benefits:**
- Sidecar acts as a proxy for each microservice
- Handles all network logic (security, retry, monitoring, communication)
- Third-party application that cluster operators can configure through simple API
- Developers can focus on actual business logic
- No need to add sidecar configuration to microservice deployment YAML files

### Service Mesh Architecture
**Components:**
1. **Control Plane:** Manages the entire service mesh
2. **Data Plane:** Network of sidecar proxies
3. **Automatic Injection:** Service mesh automatically injects proxy in every microservice pod

**How It Works:**
- Microservices communicate through proxies
- Control plane + proxies = **Service Mesh**
- Clear separation between application logic and service mesh logic

## 4. Traffic Split Feature

### What is Traffic Split?
One of the most important features of service mesh is **traffic split configuration**

### Use Case: Canary Deployment
**Scenario:** New version of payment microservice is deployed

**Problem:** 
- Tests may not catch all bugs
- New version might have issues in production
- Could cost company money if broken

**Solution:**
- Send only 1% or 10% of traffic to new version initially
- Monitor performance and stability
- Gradually increase traffic if everything works

**Example Configuration:**
- 90% traffic → Payment Service v2.0
- 10% traffic → Payment Service v3.0 (new version)

**Result:** Canary deployment pattern for safe rollouts

## 5. Istio Implementation

### What is Istio?
- **Istio** is one implementation of the service mesh pattern
- Service mesh is a pattern/paradigm, Istio is a specific implementation

### Istio Architecture

#### Data Plane Components
**Envoy Proxies:**
- Independent open-source project
- Used by Istio and many other service mesh implementations
- Act as sidecar proxies for each microservice

#### Control Plane Components
**Istiod (Istio Daemon):**
- Single control plane component
- Manages and injects Envoy proxies in each microservice pod
- **Note:** Earlier versions (up to 1.5) had multiple components:
  - Citadel
  - Mixer
  - Galley
  - Other components
- **Current:** All combined into single Istiod component for easier operation

### Architecture Summary
**Istio Architecture = Control Plane + Data Plane**
- **Control Plane:** Istiod component
- **Data Plane:** Group of all Envoy proxies
