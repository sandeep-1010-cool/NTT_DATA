# This is a placeholder for the istio-configuration-approach.png image
# The actual image should show:
# - Title: "How to configure Istio?"
# - Two key points with thumbs-up icons:
#   - "Istio is configured with Kubernetes YAML files" with Kubernetes logo and YAML document icon
#   - "no need to learn Istio specific language"
# - Prominent "CRD" box in center
# - Three bullet points with play icons:
#   - "extending the Kubernetes API"
#   - "custom Kubernetes component/object for e.g. third-party technologies (like Istio, Prometheus, etc.)"
#   - "can be used like any other native Kubernetes objects"
# - Muted grey background with faint blue triangular shapes
