| Functionality                                          | Service                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Source Code Management                                 | Azure Repos                     |
| Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) | Azure Pipelines                 |
| Project Management                                     | Azure Boards                    |
| Artifact Management (like NuGet, npm)                  | Azure Artifacts                 |
